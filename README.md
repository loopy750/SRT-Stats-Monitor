‚ö†Ô∏è This is a beta release ‚ö†Ô∏è

NOTE: If updating from a previous version !!!

This program does not modify 'config.ini', it only reads it. v0.9.6 has two additional features that must be manually added to the [config] section to be enabled:

```
SceneLBRDelay=0
AllowResize=false
```

The 'readme.txt' file explains in depth how these function.

- Added support for OBS WebSocket 5.x.x (requires latest build available from https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/actions)
- Added 'SceneLBRDelay' configuration - see readme.txt for instructions
- Added 'AllowResize' configuration - see readme.txt for instructions
